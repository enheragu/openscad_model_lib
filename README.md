# openscad_tools

Set of models in [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/) to be used from misc, mechanical and electronical parts along with some utils (functions and modules for specific geometries).

I use this repo as a library of my designs to have them together and organized.

You will find some usefull items along with other random stuff. I think that in many cases doing random stuff is a nice way to learn new math and 3d design concepts.

It is work in progess and I add new stuff whenever I need it.

## Repo structure
- misc: Some random stuff with not a very defined category :)
- mechanical_parts
  - screw_bolts
- electronic_parts
  - boards
  - elements
- utils: some modules and functions that I find useful to have to be used in the designs.

I like repos where you can see at first glance what's it about. You will find images and documentation for each of the models so runnning OpenSCAD with the code is not needed for a fast check.

## Feedback

Hey, if you have any feedback about any of this (errors, enhancements, or just comments about the code), do not hesitate in contacting!
