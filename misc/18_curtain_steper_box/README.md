First idea taken from [this post](https://www.instructables.com/Motorized-WiFi-IKEA-Roller-Blind/). I had to redesign the pieces as my curtain is a bit different.

First verion (`curtain_steper_box.scad`) had the motor in line with the curtain axis. When tested this motor proved to have not enough torque to move it, so I had to make second version (`curtain_steper_box_v2.scad`), which includes gears to cope with that issue.

In the following images the original piece, the first version and the second version of the model can be seen:
