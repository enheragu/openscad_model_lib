Some time ago I made a similar design ([thing 662476](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:662476)) based on this one: [thing 582221](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:582221).

The customizer ofers a set of options that you can play with. You will have two print two versions, check the percentaje for each of the parts.
